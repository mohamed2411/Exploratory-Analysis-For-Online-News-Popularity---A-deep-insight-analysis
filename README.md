# Exploratory-Analysis-For-Online-News-Popularity---A-deep-insight-analysis

In this project, the goal is the explore the dataset given and be able to find critical insights that can be used to influence potential article Shares_category. Also, machine learning models was built to be able to predict the Shares_category of a given article.


The process followed is highlighted below:

- Data Cleaning - Noise detection and removal
- Subjective analysis - Using our intuition to evaluate a data variable/feature and decide whether a variable influences the Shares of the article or not.
- Quantitative Analysis - How correct is our intuition? Here we carry our several analysis to accept or debunk our initial hypothesis
- Normal Distribuiton Observation on the dataset
- Feature Selection and Evaluation
- Machine Learning Classification
- Summary and Conclusion.


## Ideas to consider

- What is the effect of number of images/number of videos on the article Shares?

- Is their a relationship between the number of words in the content and/or
  number of words in the title in the article Shares?

- Is their a concrete relationship between average length of words in the content to the Shares?

- Create a grading/rank for the Shares: Low, Medium, High, Excellent?

- How is the ranking of the channels in regards to the shares Shares?

- What data channel has the most popularity and what feature in that particular data channel contributes towards that asserction. Is this also observed in the other data channels?

-What about the effects of the Worst, Best, and Avg keywords?

-Is their an influence on the min, max or avg shares on each article referenced articles. Does the number of shares in those referenced articles also influence the number of   shares in the main article?

- At what point in the weekend do people share articles the most? Can that means people read those articles the most on those days?

- What is the effect of LDA analysis on the article popularity ?

- Does article with more text sentiment influence the popularity

- what the is relationship between the text sentiment and the article publish day? Are more sentiment on a particlar day?

- How about the influence of postive/negative words in the text sentiment and popularity. Do people favours postive worded article. What is ratio of postive to negative word   articles in the dataset? Are the mutually balanced and can we make a judgment based on that alone?

- What about the effect of subjectivity on the title and test in the Shares ?
